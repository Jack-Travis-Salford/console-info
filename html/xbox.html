				<p>The Xbox Series X is one of the latest released consoles released by Microsoft (the other being Xbox Series S), designed to be able to play the very latest games at high frame rates at the common 1080p resolution,
				as well as claiming to achieve a decent 60fps at the increasingly more popular 4K resolution. It was released on the 10th November, 2 days before Sony's release of the PS5. <b>The xbox released at a price of £450</b>, the 
				same as the PS5 - Standard Edition (the vesion with a disk drive). This version of the Xbox comes with a disk drive, allowing you to play physical copies games, rather than digital only. </p>

				<p>The Xbox Series X has a faster CPU and better GPU in comparison to the PS5, possibly allowing for a few extra <abbr title="Frames per second">fps</abbr> during graphically intense areas of the
				next gen games. It also has a bigger storage, albeit slower storage device, allowing for more games to be stored before requiring an external storage device, but potentially longer loading screens,
				due to longer IO throughput times. </p>

				<h2>Onine Access and Game Pass</h2>
				<p>In order to access the online features, such as online multiplayer, you must first purchase a subscription to Xbox Live Gold. This can either be purchased on a monthly basics for £7 (£84 per year), or on a
				quarterly (every 3 months) basics for £18 (£72 per year). As of current, xbox no longer sell a 12 month subscription. Xbox Live Gold gives you access to any online features of games, as well as providing
				2 free games every month and exclusive discounts in the store, of which wouldn't be avaliable for someone without Xbox Live Gold. This works out at potentially more than the subscription for the PlayStation,
				which offers their online service for £50 every year.</p>
				<p>Microsoft also sells a game pass, formally known as Xbox Game Pass, for £8 per month (£96 per year). This gives anyone who subscribes free access to over 100 games, as well as member discounts and deals.
				Most games avaliable are games which have been made backwards compatible, as well as release day access to any title from Xbox Game Studios. A similar service, called PS Now, is offered by Sony for their 
				PlayStation, allowing for a yearly subscription of £50. </p>
				<p>Microsoft also offer a Game Pass Ultimate, which includes both Xbox Live Gold and the Game Pass, along with a few extra perks and EA Play (which could otherwise be purchase for £20 per year). This 
				is billed at £11 per month (£132 per year) for content that would cost £188 if bought separately.</p>
