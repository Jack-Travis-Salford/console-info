				<p> The PS5 is the latest console produced by Sony, designed to play the latest games at high frame rates at 1080p, as well as allowing the possibility to also use 4k resolution. It was released on the 
				12th November 2020, 2 days after the competitor, Xbox, released their console. There are 2 edition as of release day: A <b>digital edition, priced at £360</b>, and the <b>standard edition, priced at 
				£450</b> (the same price as the Xbox Series X). The main difference between these editions is that the digital edition doesn't have a disc drive, therefore requiring all games to be purchased 
				for the PlayStation Store in a digital format. If you would normally buy the games you like on release day, and are not bothered about collectors editions (which usually come with a physical copy of the 
				game), or are happy to wait until any sales before getting older games you enjoy, then the digital edition is probably better for you. If you usually get your games after their release date, then you would 
				probably find said games cheaper in physical formats and would benefit from the disk drive. </p>

				<p>The PS5 has very similar stats to that of the Xbox Series X, the differences being a slower <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr> &#038; and graphics card, but a faster (albeit smaller) 
				storage device. The differences in performance shouldn't be too noticeable, especially  if gaming at <abbr title="Full High Definition">FHD/1080p</abbr>, as both should be very capable at producing 
				high <abbr title="Frames Per Second">fps</abbr>. Both consoles advertise their ability to provide high framerates @ 4k resolution, a higher resolution that is becoming more  popular. </p>
				<p>The biggest advantage of the PS5 is its much faster storage access speed, more than double that of the Xbox Series X, which could allow for loading screens to take less time to disappear.</p>

				<h2>Online Access and Game Pass</h2>

				an overall greater yearly cost) and grants access to online sections of games, as well as providing 2 free games per month and exclusive discounts on other games and dlc's in their PlayStation store, a similar service
				as Microsofts for the Xbox, which is priced at £72 per year (if bought quartly, no yearly option avaliable).</p>
				<p>Sony also offers a game pass subscription, called PS Now, at a price of £50 per year (monthly and quartly options avaliable at an overall greater yearly cost). This allows access to over 700 games that are
				readily avaliable to download at no extra cost, mainly consisting of older games that have been made backwards compatible. Microsoft offer a similar service for the xbox, called the Xbox Game Pass, for £96 per month.</p>
