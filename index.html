				<p>This website has been created to help you decide which next-gen console; PS5 or Xbox Series X; is the best for you, by considering the advantages and disadvantages of each console. I take in 
				consideration the technical specification of each console, as well as online access price and game passes. I decided not to take into account exclusive titles, as I can only comment on any that 
				have been confirmed, rather than any that will be released within the PlayStations lifetime.</p>
				<p>	There is a navigation bar, located at the top of the page, which will take you to information about each console, a page of definitions for greater understanding of the various specific words .
				used, as well as a page to contact me via email for any feedback or suggestions. There is also a navigation section, located at the top or left side of your screen (depending on the size of your 
				screen), that will allow you to jump to the part of the page which you are interested in. Located at the bottom is a link to the official web page of each console. Due to high demand of each console.
