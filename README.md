University year 1 assignment

A simple website created for an assignment in the first year of uni, consisting of just HTML and CSS. JavaScript, or any framework were not allowed for this assignment. 

The webpage is responsive to different screen sizes, using a self implemented grid-based system, similar to Bootstrap. 

I am working on getting this and the website created in the 2nd year hosted. This readme will be updated if/when that happens.
